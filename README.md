# KQLIntel
KQLIntel is a powerful, browser-based tool designed to bridge the gap between unstructured threat intelligence reports and actionable Kusto Query Language (KQL) queries. It leverages the power of modern Large Language Models (LLMs) to analyze threat reports from URLs or raw text, intelligently extract IOCs, and automatically generate KQL queries.
